## 📊 Project Domains Covered

- ✅ **DSBDA (Data Science & Big Data Analytics)**
  - Data collection, preprocessing, and visualization.
  - Applied machine learning for crop yield prediction based on historical data.
  - Feature engineering and evaluation using scikit-learn.

- ✅ **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
  - Implemented ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest) for agricultural yield forecasting.
  - Smart recommendation system based on AI-driven insights.
  - Built a prediction pipeline using supervised learning.

- ✅ **Cloud Computing (CC)**
  - Deployed the frontend of the crop yield prediction app on Netlify, enabling browser-accessible real-time interaction.
  - Utilized cloud-based hosting to ensure availability, scalability, and a seamless user experience without local dependencies.
  - Enabled real-time ML predictions through a web interface by integrating frontend and backend logic in a cloud-supported architecture.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **User Input** — Users enter details like crop type, soil type, climate conditions, and nutrients.
2. **Cloud Processing** — Data is sent to cloud-hosted servers for ML processing.
3. **AI Prediction** — The ML model predicts yield based on the input and trained data.
4. **Insights Delivery** — The system returns actionable recommendations and data visualizations.
